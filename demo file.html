                Hi there, this is a demo video of a project I did for my fullstack web development class.
                For this project we were asked to create a website that allows users to create channels, post questions,
                get replies to their questions or reply another users question. Users can also upvote or downvote questions and also
                edit their profile. An admin can also log into the admin page and edit the users, channels and questions.
                To execute this project, I made use of React for the frontend, node.js for the backend, mysql for the database and docker hub to run the React application for both the frontend, backend and database.
